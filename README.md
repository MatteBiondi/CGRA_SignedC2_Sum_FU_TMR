# CGRA_SignedC2_Sum_FU_TMR
Designing a Functional Unit (FU) of a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) architecture for signed C2 sums with 8-bit input and output data, 2-bit flag(carry, overflow, etc.), ready-valid communication protocol along the entire data chain and fault detection and correction (TMR) mechanisms on the combinatorial part of the architecture
